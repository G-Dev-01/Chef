# 'The Chef' Recipes Website

From a stay-in dinner for one to that special festive dinner.
'The Chef' is a website which enables the search for that special recipe 
during the planning of your event.

Using 'key words' your search will return listings of beautifully illustrated recipies.

Each recipe provides a list of the ingridients, preparation instructions, as well as detailed nutritional information taking into account special dietary requirements.

Planning your dinner event starts with a simple search at The Chef!!!



## UX
the UX is relatively simple comsyisting of a simgle page illustrated using a
chopping board with measures of various food ingredients as an inviting backdrop to 'The Chef'
A key word may be entered in order to search for meal recipes to facilitate the planning of a dinner event.
