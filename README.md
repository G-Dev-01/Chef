# The Chef Recipes Website

From a stay-in dinner for one to that special festive dinner.
The Chef is a website which enables the search for that special recipe 
during the planning of your event.

Using 'key words' your search will return listings of beautifully illustrated recipies.

Each recipe provides a list of the ingridients, preparation instructions, as well as detailed nutritional information taking into account special dietary requirements.

Planning your dinner event starts with a simple search at The Chef!!!

Github offers a hosting facility for static web pages and is quite straight forward if you have a Github account and repository for your code.

Publishing may be done from any of the branches in a repository.

I have used 'master' for this website.
From the G-Dev-01 Repository, I clicked on settings and scrolled down to Github Pages in order to select the source, in this case this was the master main branch/root.

Clicked on Save
