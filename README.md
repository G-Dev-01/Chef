# The Chef Recipes Website

From a stay-in dinner for one to that special festive dinner.
The Chef is a website which enables the search for that special recipe 
during the planning of your event.

Using 'key words' your search will return listings of beautifully illustrated recipies.

Each recipe provides a list of the ingridients, preparation instructions, as well as detailed nutritional information taking into account special dietary requirements.

Planning your dinner event starts with a simple search at The Chef!!!
